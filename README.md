# React-MultiSelect-Filter

## Description

This application implements a multi-select filter akin to those used in e-commerce websites.
There is a dummy database of clothing products which is rendered on the app to show how the filters work. There are 3 filters that are implemented in the project --> you can search a product by its name, select a category and choose a price range of products. The products are filtered instantly without the page being reloaded.
